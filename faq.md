 - question: I have outstanding equity in my home. How do I get started on tapping into this equity?
   answer: Divtera allows you to offer up to 20% of your home’s equity on our platform! We’ll start off by having your home appraised by a third party, independent appraiser. Once we know the value of your home, we’ll offer it on our marketplace to investors, who can buy shares in your home’s equity offering. Once all of the outstanding shares have been purchased by interested investors, you’ll receive a lump sum payment for the equity.

 - question: What can I use the money for?
   answer: 
    - You can use the money made from selling your equity on Divtera for any purpose.

 - question: How is this different from a HELOC?
   answer: 
    - There is no interest charged on the money you receive from Divtera, and you don’t have to deal with early closure fees or annual fees charged by HELOCs. Once you receive the cash, it’s all yours.

 - question: Will the title of my home be affected?
   answer: 
    - No, Divtera will not be added to your title. Instead, we file an option on the title, which will be recorded with your county of residence. This option will record Divtera’s percentage ownership stake in your home.

 - question: Do I need to pay Divtera back if I don’t sell my house?
   answer: 
    - If you don’t sell your home, you will never have to pay Divtera or any of the investors back the equity sale or on our platform. This isn’t a loan; it’s a cash investment from investors who are buying the equity in your home. Once you sell your home, Divtera will keep the percentage we own from the sale (excluding appreciation/depreciation due to modifications you’ve made).
    - Let’s take the following example. Say your home is worth $100,000, and you offer 10%, or $10,000 on our platform to investors. 15 years later, your home has appreciated to $200,000 and you plan to sell your home. Once you sell your home, investors will keep 10% of the sale, which would be $20,000 in this case.
 
 - question: Who decides how much my home is worth?
   answer:
    - When you tap into your home equity by selling a portion of your home on our platform, we will have a 3rd party company perform an appraisal of your home to determine its value. The same is true when you decide to sell your home, and share the proceeds with investors.
 
 - question: What happens if I make modifications to my home?
   answer:
    - When you sell your home, we will subtract any appreciation or depreciation resulting from home modifications, as determined by a 3rd party appraiser, from the sale price. The remainder will be the value you split with investors.

 - question: How does Divtera make money?
   answer:
    - Homeowners pay a small fee, calculated as a percentage of the overall value of the equity being placed on the platform ( < 3%). This is lower than the APR you would get from HELOC providers. We may also charge management fees to investors in the future.
 
 - question: Can I buy back the equity in my house?
   answer:
    - At this time, you cannot buy back equity from investors. We hope to offer this soon.

  - question: When will I receive my returns?
    answer:
      - At this time, investors will only receive a return on their investment when the underlying property is sold by the homeowner. Soon, you’ll be able to buy and sell shares from one another on a peer-to-peer marketplace.

  - question: How do I know that my investment in a house is priced accurately?
    answer:
      - When a home is listed on the platform, we go through a third party appraisal. We will price the shares based on the percentage of equity the homeowner is offering and the appraised value of the home.

  - question: How is my ownership represented?
    answer:
      - Divtera records the ownership percentage via an option on the property title. Your shares are declared as interests in this option. When the underlying property is sold by the homeowner, you will receive a portion of the sale as defined by your interests in the option.

  - question: How I find out when a property is sold?
    answer: 
      - Since we have an option on the title of the property, we will be alerted as soon as there is any indication of a sale. We will work with the homeowner and their bank to ensure the proper percentage is taken out from the sale price; at this point, you’ll receive your share of the sale based on your ownership of shares.

  - question: Who pays the property taxes and other costs of maintaining the property?
    answer:
      - These are the sole responsibility of the property owner. However, both homeowners and investors will be responsible for their share of the appreciation tax upon sale of the home, computed by the percentage of equity owned per party.

  - question: How will I stay up to date with the properties I’m invested in?
    answer:
      - After you invest on our platform, you will be able to see the number of shares you bought and their current value in your dashboard based on the marketplace. We’ll also keep you up to date with any appraisal reports done on the home in the same panel. We plan to provide frequent appraisal data to give you further insight into your investments.
